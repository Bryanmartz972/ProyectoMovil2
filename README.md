# Prometheus Mobile App API
This is an API elaborated for the class of Mobile Programming 2. This is the first API that I made and introduct me into this area. This project was made by a team of 3 people led by me.
This API was elaborated for a fictional store that sells workout and exercising clothing called Prometheus.

## Description of the project
This project was elaborated with Javascript, Node.js and Express. It also use for storing the clothes and sales of the store with a MySQL database. We use the tool Postman to make calls to the API for testing it.

This API was connected to a React Native application for phones which we also made. We made an app for the client, which he or she can make the purchase, and another app for the employee of the store, which he or she can add new products, restock inventory and delete or modify products on sale. Here are the links for the repositories:

- React Native employee application: https://github.com/Bryanmartz972/ProyectoMovil2ReactEmpleado   


## Installation
For trying the project locally on your computer, either clone the repository or download the .zip folder and extract it in any folder you like.
Once you have the project, with Visual Studio Code terminal or any other Bash program (like Git Bash) run the following commands:

```bash
  npm i //For installing dependencies
  npm run dev //For running the project. It will open on port 3001

```
Also for trying out the project you need to import the "proyectomovil2.sql" file located in the root directory of the project to MySQL Workbench. Also changing in the src/configs/db.js the lines for the connection with the database. 

With that all done, you are ready to go.
